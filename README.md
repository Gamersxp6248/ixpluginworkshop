# ixpluginworkshop

This is where I will be uploading my helix plugins (including forks of already public plugins), for everyone to use and PR.



## itemlist fork en

This plugin is a fork of Rune Knight \& Khall's item spawnmenu, spruced up to look nicer, and gives the user extra tools to play with, as well as a few utility functions.

This is generally just a modernized version of the item spawnmenu that I've been working on for personal benefit, and chose to release publicly for everyone.

I really look up to Khall, and was a little disappointed that the itemlist plugin was missing some features that could be used by many.

This resources is, of course, public; Khall is free to take what I have coded here and put it in the original itemlist plugin, in which this would be deprecated.



## itemlist fork ru

Russian translation of the previous plugin.
